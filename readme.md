## Daycare Project with MERN stack

this application is a personal daycare system that I did for my family, currently receive $12k in monthly payments, which made managing everything much easier,  no more keeping information on paper about whoâ€™s going to come this week,  who paid, etc. now all that my parents need to do is use four buttons, check-in, check-out, late and generate registration code.

2024 - most users stopped using but we still have a few that need the payment plan, total payments = 130k
we're going to shut down the application soon, the last user if finishing their payments ðŸ¥³
