## Daycare Project with MERN stack

I created a simple daycare system for my family. It made managing things much easier, replacing the old way of tracking schedules and payments on paper. The system handles $12k in monthly payments, and my parents only need to use four buttons: check-in, check-out, late, and generate registration code.

By 2024, most users had stopped using it, but a few still needed the payment plan. Now, we're about to shut it down as the last user is finishing their payments ðŸ¥³.
